## 5x Margin Tool

### Project Description

5x Margin Tool is designed as a gas-effective, under-collateralized protocol for margin trading and yield farming purposes. It provides LPs with a good chance of earning high APY and traders with a convenient virtual account that offers 5x leverage trading options.

A virtual account provides access to a list of allowed pools on the most popular decentralized exchanges (Uniswap, SushiSwap, 1inch), where traders can buy & sell any asset. They are also welcome to use funds for whitelisted yield farming projects. There is no open access to the funds as they are safely kept in the Margin Tool contracts.
